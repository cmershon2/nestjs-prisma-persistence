# NestJS Persistence Module with Prisma
This repository contains the source code for a NestJS project demonstrating how to build a persistence module using Prisma.

## Introduction
In this project, I set up Prisma to manage database interactions within a NestJS application. I create a dedicated persistence module to encapsulate database logic. This makes sure that the codebase remains modular and maintainable.

I also created an example user module to demonstrate how the persistence module can be implemented. Please note that the user module is simply for demonstration and should not be used in production enviroments as no authentication has been implemented.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
